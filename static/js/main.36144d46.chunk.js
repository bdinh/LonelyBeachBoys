These chemists came up with a series of mathematical models to predict the growth of yeast and existence of extra flavor compounds such as fusel alcohols and esters in beer. Their models were far more rigorous than previous attempts, and continue to be cited today. They are imperfect, however, and don\u2019t account for everything which can lead to off flavors - in fact, the science behind brewing good beer is incomplete, and new discoveries continue to be made (Olaniran, Hiralal, Mokoena & Pillay, 2017). The aforementioned necessity of by-products in beer and their tenuous relationship with the pallet are responsible for this complexity. For example, according to Olaniran et al. (2017), Isoamyl - which is a higher alcohol produced by yeast as part of the brewing process - is a sought after compound in beer due to its \u201cheavy\u201d effect on taste, but it leads to off flavors if it exceeds \u201c20% of the total amount of n-propanol, isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol.\u201d Many such balancing acts exist within the brewing process, and the difficulty they impart is exacerbated by the relatively few knobs and dials a brewer has at their disposal."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"A brewer bears more resemblance to a zookeeper than a cook, as their most important job is to keep the yeast happy, healthy, and entertained with the proper substances.

Even measuring properties like off flavors is a feat unknown to the bucket-brewer, requiring esoteric knowledge and equipment to even attempt. Marsili et al. (2007) make note that \u201cBeer contains dozens of odor active chemical components in concentrations ranging from percent to parts-per-trillion (ppt)\u201c as they propose a new method of quantitatively measuring off flavors in beer. Because the typical homebrewer cannot be expected to measure variation in compounds which are described in ppt, or understand the inner workings of a polydimethylsiloxane extraction, they are restricted to highly subjective qualitative analysis.

We propose using these parameters to create a model capable of predicting the final quality of a beer. In doing so we hope to glean some insight into what aspects of the brewing process are most important to the final quality. Since it is almost as difficult to quantitatively assess the quality of the beer (which we define here as the absence of off flavors), we will be using aggregate recipe ratings sourced from a popular homebrew website as our metric.

Notice that unlike fermentables and hops, these variables did not take into account the weight of ingredients in a certain category. This is due to the catch-all-nature of other ingredients. A single ounce of vanilla extract will have a much larger impact on the flavor of a beer than an ounce of ginger since it is a far stronger spice.
