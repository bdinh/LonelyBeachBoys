There are many different approaches, starting points, and strategies, but it all boils down to taking an unfermented grain derivative and turning it into beer (as if, as was previously thought, by magic). As it turns out, this is a rather complicated undertaking, and there are many communities devoted to figuring out how to brew good beer. These communities can be found everywhere from the university, to the dive bar, and the pursuit of brewing perfection pervades research papers as much as online forums."),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"normal-para"},"Chemists seem especially drawn to brewing, since, unlike most industrial fermentation processes designed to produce one thing in quantity which is then extracted and purified, beer is itself both the process and the final product - all the byproducts are a part of the beer (Gee & Ramirez, 1994). These chemists came up with a series of mathematical models to predict the growth of yeast and existence of extra flavor compounds such as fusel alcohols and esters in beer. Their models were far more rigorous than previous attempts, and continue to be cited today. They are imperfect, however, and don\u2019t account for everything which can lead to off flavors - in fact, the science behind brewing good beer is incomplete, and new discoveries continue to be made (Olaniran, Hiralal, Mokoena & Pillay, 2017). The aforementioned necessity of by-products in beer and their tenuous relationship with the pallet are responsible for this complexity. For example, according to Olaniran et al. (2017), Isoamyl - which is a higher alcohol produced by yeast as part of the brewing process - is a sought after compound in beer due to its \u201cheavy\u201d effect on taste, but it leads to off flavors if it exceeds \u201c20% of the total amount of n-propanol, isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol.\u201d Many such balancing acts exist within the brewing process, and the difficulty they impart is exacerbated by the relatively few knobs and dials a brewer has at their disposal."),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"normal-para"},"A brewer bears more resemblance to a zookeeper than a cook, as their most important job is to keep the yeast happy, healthy, and entertained with the proper substances. Since the yeast is doing all the real work - eating, excreting, and eventually lying dormant at the bottom of a bottle (in this they bear a striking resemblance to the human race) - and since the balance of what they produce and for how long can be impacted by just about everything going on in the wort, every minor tweak to process or ingredient has a cascading effect throughout the beer. Even measuring properties like off flavors is a feat unknown to the bucket-brewer, requiring esoteric knowledge and equipment to even attempt. Marsili et al. (2007) make note that \u201cBeer contains dozens of odor active chemical components in concentrations ranging from percent to parts-per-trillion (ppt)\u201c as they propose a new method of quantitatively measuring off flavors in beer. Because the typical homebrewer cannot be expected to measure variation in compounds which are described in ppt, or understand the inner workings of a polydimethylsiloxane extraction, they are restricted to highly subjective qualitative analysis. Such analysis usually takes the form of \u201cthis tastes good,\u201d or \u201cthis tastes like the inside of a shoe,\u201d which is not especially useful except when taken in aggregate."),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"normal-para"},"As mentioned previously, a brewer has at their fingertips a number of knobs and dials, each of which has a multitude inscrutable, overlapping effects on the final product. These include standardized parameters and measures of the brewing process (such as boil time, original gravity (OG), final gravity (FG), chill method, pitch rate, hopping method, etc.) as well as the ingredients (attenuation, flocculation, yeast type, alpha acid units (AAU\u2019s), hop type, etc.). We propose using these parameters to create a model capable of predicting the final quality of a beer. In doing so we hope to glean some insight into what aspects of the brewing process are most important to the final quality. Since it is almost as difficult to quantitatively assess the quality of the beer (which we define here as the absence of off flavors), we will be using aggregate recipe ratings sourced from a popular homebrew website as our metric. In this way we hope to predict beer quality based on features that a homebrewer has reasonable control over, and provide a utility that they can use to get an idea of how good a recipe might turn out before devoting the time and money required to brew it.")),r.a.createElement(v.a,{xs:12},r.a.createElement("h2",null,"Our Work"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"normal-para"},"Our work is documented within this ",r.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://github.com/bdinh/LonelyBeachBoys"},"Github Repository"),".
