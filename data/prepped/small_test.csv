Due to the largehop bill for this recipe, a full wort boil is recommended. Steep grains in 1 gallon (3.8 L)of water at 165° F (74° C) for 30 minutes, then remove and rinse grains with hot water.Stir in dextrose and top up kettle to 8 gallons (30 L), and bring to a boil. Add hops asindicated in the recipe. After a 90 minute boil, chill wort to 67° F (19° C) and transfer tofermenter. Pitch two packages of yeast or a yeast starter and aerate well. Ferment at 67°F (19° C) until fermentation activity subsides, then rack to secondary. Add first set of dryhops on top of the racked beer and age 7-9 days then add the second set. Age five moredays then bottle or keg the beer

Vi anbefaler en mengde mellom 250 g (mildt) og 1 kg (veldig kraftig). 500 g kan være et greit utgangspunkt og gir et godt merkbart, men ikke totalt dominerende ingefær-preg. Mengden meske- og skyllevann du bør bruke kommer an på utstyret og metoden du brygger med. Som et anslag kan vi si at du kan bruke 20 l meskevann og 13 l skyllevann til dette ølet. Noen bryggemaskiner (f.eks. Speidel Braumeister) kan kreve større mengder meskevann. Sjekk alltid manualen på utstyret du bruker. Mesking på 66 grader i 60 min. Utmesk på 77 grader i 5 min hvis du har mulighet til å øke temperatur i mesken.  Kjøl ned til 17 grader før pitching av gjær. Gjæring på 18 grader til stormgjæring begynner å avta (typisk etter 3-5 dager). Øk deretter til 20 grader og hold resten av gjæringsperioden (totalt 14 dager). Tørrhumle etter 5 dager. Gjæralternativer: WLP001, WLP007, WLP028, WLP051, WLP090, Danstar Nottingham
