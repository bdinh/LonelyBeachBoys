Then baked for another 45 mins at 350. Let it cool to 154 and add to mash. For the vanilla bean vodka solution, two vanilla beans are cut in half.  The seeds and goodies are then scraped into 4oz of vodka. Let the vodka sit for two weeks.

Too much honey will make the beer too dry and more alcohol forward than it needs to be.   I looked up how to make cinnamon or ginger tea, which is what we are doing in the wort, and it seems that putting them in at 15 minutes left in the boil and leaving them in for 15 minutes after flame out makes the best sense.  The video I made on YouTube says 60 minutes but I've changed it since I made that video. Great Holiday beer. Cheers !

Vi anbefaler en mengde mellom 250 g (mildt) og 1 kg (veldig kraftig). 500 g kan være et greit utgangspunkt og gir et godt merkbart, men ikke totalt dominerende ingefær-preg. Mengden meske- og skyllevann du bør bruke kommer an på utstyret og metoden du brygger med. Som et anslag kan vi si at du kan bruke 20 l meskevann og 13 l skyllevann til dette ølet. Noen bryggemaskiner (f.eks. Speidel Braumeister) kan kreve større mengder meskevann. Sjekk alltid manualen på utstyret du bruker. Mesking på 66 grader i 60 min. Utmesk på 77 grader i 5 min hvis du har mulighet til å øke temperatur i mesken.  Kjøl ned til 17 grader før pitching av gjær. Gjæring på 18 grader til stormgjæring begynner å avta (typisk etter 3-5 dager). Øk deretter til 20 grader og hold resten av gjæringsperioden (totalt 14 dager). Tørrhumle etter 5 dager. Gjæralternativer: WLP001, WLP007, WLP028, WLP051, WLP090, Danstar Nottingham
