I tend to shy away from anything Crystal/Cara in these types of hoppy beers. The resulting beer will be just a tad lighter in color. So, if you really wanted to, you could consider small amounts of Munich or Victory to fill the gap. But the hops, yeast and water profile are what make this beer shine.

If pitched ""too early"" (i.e., 25-50%) you may lose out on some hop aroma that is being pushed out via CO2. However, you might gain on the supposed biotransformation benefits. On the other hand, if pitched ""too late"" you may preserve more hop aroma, but lose on some of the supposed benefits of the hop/yeast biotransformation interactions.

Thanks for the feedback!@rel - The default hop utilization for the Brewer's Friend whirlpool is 10%. I adjusted mine down to 4% because it seemed to be more in line with my experience. But it is far from scientific. So YMMV. In my experience the hop bitterness is very restrained from whirlpool additions made at the 150-170 F range.@Pikk - Sorry for the delay if you have already brewed this. But the intent was for you to cool to 170 F, stop the cooling, add the whirlpool hops and gently stir here and there over the course of 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, continue to cool down to pitching temp and transfer to the fermenter.@mlatner - It sounds like the LAIII yeast are doing their thing. This yeast comes in strong and finishes the job pretty quickly, in my experience. And it is very forgiving if you don't have the ability to control ferm. temps. The 1.072 is a bit higher than I tend to start with. I don't know if your efficiency was well below 70% and/or your wort volume was lesser due to boil off, etc., but your beer should be fine. You may finish a little bit higher in the .14 - .16 range. But just rely on your hydrometer to tell you when the yeast are done. Let me know how it turns out!@danlatimer - I'm sorry for your disappointment. Not sure if you are kegging or bottling. But I will say that given the significance of the hop bill, a lot of hop matter falls to the bottom of the keg. So, your first few pints could have a higher concentration of this material which contributes to a pronounced bitterness. This bitterness is a bit different from your normal IPA bitterness and tends to hit the back of the throat. Hopefully with a little more cold conditioning, time, and pints poured, your beer comes around a bit. If so, please let me know. I hope it works out!",N/A,11/05/2017,08:42pm

https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/363082/avg-perfect-northeast-ipa-neipa-,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/49801,kcq101,"@miggy_smalls - Yes, that is correct. There is no traditional ""bittering"" addition at the beginning of the boil.  Given the beer style (lower bitterness than traditional IPAs), the significance of the late hop quantities, and the extended contact time of the hops post-boil in the whirlpool, there is no need for something at the beginning of the boil. Just add the hops with 10 minutes remaining in the boil and, then, once you have cooled your wort down to ~170 F after the boil.If you might want to add something at the beginning of the boil to up the bitterness a bit, I'd suggest adding ~.25 oz of something like Columbus/CTZ as a first wort hop (pre-boil) which I've done with this base recipe before and it's given me good results.

https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/16367/southern-tier-pumking-clone,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection,[email protected],"I've tried to perfect my own seasonal pumpkin ale in the past, but to no avail. I'm going to give this recipe a try. However, one problem is fresh pumpkins aren't available in my area until right about the time we'd be consuming a pumpkin ale. I want to brew a batch this summer and let it condition in the bottle for a few months before enjoying in October. So here's the question...what's a close alternative to adding real roosted pumpkin to the mash. I was thinking of adding 2oz of good quality pumpkin powder (roosted if I can find it) to the spice mix that's tossed in at the 5min mark, or maybe using canned pumpkin and roasting it in the oven and adding it to the mash (similar to the recipe) or perhaps using canned pumpkin and roasting it in the oven then adding it to the secondary before racking. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",N/A,07/07/2013,07:31pm
https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/16367/southern-tier-pumking-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/955,mackeydj,"I would try the canned pumpkin before the pumpkin powder, because spices can become overpowering really easily.  You could also try using yams.  Yams will add a similar squash flavor the pumpkin adds and they are much easier to find all year.  The spices are what really make pumpkin beer show its character. If you really want to use the pumpkin powder, I would air on the side of caution and add an ounce the last 5 mins of the boil.  Then if you think it needs more when you transfer to secondary add a little more, maybe a teaspoon, tablespoon or however much you think it needs.",N/A,07/31/2013,03:36am

Also you will want to get the wort off the yeast cake or the yeast could produce off flavors.To rack to the secondary is very similar to when you bottle.

So with refractometer correction that currently puts the beer around 6.5%. My OG was 1.090 and I was hoping to finish out fermentation around 1.020.

I've been fermenting at 68, but i thought I'd raise the fermentation temp to 71 this third week in hopes to continue fermentation.

Unfortunately, I grossly missed the OG. Preboil gravity was fine, but I think my boil was just low since I ended up with a higher volume of wort than planned. So it's looking like I'll only be seeing an ABV between 5.5 and 6.5% ish. So let's call this a ""session"" Pumking for all intended purposes. :P Anyway, like the rest of you, I'm excited to see how this comes out.",N/A,10/06/2018,02:43am

Somehow I ended up with 8 gallons in the kettle rather than the 7 per the water numbers in the recipe so I'm guessing my grain absorption is less than predicted...  something for me to figure out.  One thing I'm wondering about though from those who've done this one...  how long did you leave the cinnamon sticks in?   I've had pumpkin beers before that (to me) were too heavy on the cinamon.  And when I tasted the wort as I put it in the fermentor I could pick out the cinnamon flavor.

Although delicious, mine turned out very different than the original ST. Having them side by side with the group, everyone preferred this one and didn't want to drink the ST anymore. It makes the ST's flavors seem fake and almost perfume-like. It was also much darker and didn't drop clear.  It was a really big hit with the group though.

I don't know that it's an exact clone of Pumpking. The color I got was much darker. Not black but thick caramel brown, maybe about a 28 SRM. In my opinion, it tastes better than Pumking. It's a heavy hitter though, and it's a lot of flavor. Definitely a sipper and not a crushable beer. My ABV came in at about 8.95%. OG: 1.074, FG: 1.006.One issued I ran into was this beer has been in bottles for about 6 weeks and it still isn't carbonated to the extent I would like. So maybe the yeast just needs more time or maybe I filtered too much of it out. Not quite sure, but something to consider for others looking to brew the same beer.

I used two tubes of WLP029.-I only used 2 oz of vanilla extract instead of the 4 oz your recipe call for, for a 10 gal batch.

The suggested mash volume of 9.47gal seems huge and is larger than anything I've done before, and I don't think I have the equipment volume to handle that plus a gallon or two for sparging.",N/A,11/29/2017,07:23pm
https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/39433,Cameron,"Hi Derpadoo,   I utilize the BIAB (Brew in a bag) method.   That requires no sparge at all.   Now if your kettle is large enough for the boil volume but not the full volume mash then I would reduce the mash volume by  2-3 gallons and put that to the side and rinse the grains while hoisting the bag over the kettle (assuming you are using BIAB also).  Just make sure you sparge with RO water.  High PH water will extract tannins.   Here is a link to one of my videos when I had a smaller brew kettle and I had to do the same thing:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXYJ3YkBuII   and now I hooked up a gas line in my garage and got a hoist instead of just one pulley.   When I used to sparge I took a bucket and drilled a bunch of holes in it to make a giant strainer.  I put my grain bag in it, folded the bag over the opening and hoisted it the bucket.  I then would get 2-3 gallons of RO water heated up to around 170 f and used a galvanized watering can to sprinkle the water over the bucket thus rinsing out the grains and accumulating enough water for the boil.   A 15 gallon kettle is perfect for 5 gallon No sparge BIAB batches.   Cheers !",N/A,11/30/2017,01:34pm
https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/113469,Derpadoo,"Thanks for the advice Cameron. I also do BIAB and my kettle is 10gal so i'll be cutting it really close to try and get that 9.47gal mash volume. I had always though sparging was non-optional, but I guess you compensated the grain bill for the efficiency. My sparging  method thus far has been to simply rinse the grain-bag with an additional gallon or two of water (depending on how much volume I have to boil) inside my smaller 5gal kettle or a fermentation bucket, then add that rinse to the kettle. I'm relatively new and haven't gotten into water chemistry yet, but it's on my list of things to improve.I'll be trying out this recipe in a day or two. It looks great and I'm looking forward to the results!",5,12/01/2017,05:38pm
https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/39433,Cameron,I just got done kegging this recipe and it tastes great. Good luck. You can check out some of the other videos on my YouTube channel and it may give you some pointers on sparging with Brew in a bag. I used to use an 8 gallon Kettle and cut it close as well. If you have a 10 gallon kettle then you should only have to keep a couple gallons of water on the side. My efficiency was up to 75% with sparging and it is somewhere around 70% with no sparge. By not doing the sparge it says me about a half hour or so. So a 15 gallon Kettle or even a 20 gallon kettle would be perfect. Good luck and let me know how the recipe comes out. Merry Christmas,N/A,12/01/2017,06:05pm

Never used gypsum/calcium chloride, is this additive to adjust the water. I good well water and have never had an issue with off flavors. thanks",N/A,08/21/2018,12:44pm
https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/39433,Cameron,Hi dave althouse.   Yes the gypsum and calcium chloride are added because I use Reverse Osmosis Water for my brewing water.  I am a Culligan Water guy in Ohio and I am cursed with knowing too much about water :)  I have learned a lot about how the mash pH is so important to the mash process and consistency in my recipes.   If you don't see any problem with your well water that's great.  Most waters have a high amount of alkalinity which makes the pH too high during mash.  Reverse Osmosis water is absent of almost all minerals so I add them back using a free spreadsheet tool called Brun Water. This tool lets you dial in your target water profile.  Using Reverse Osmosis water for your brewing water is the #1 way to get make a  superior beer in my humble opinion.  Cheers !,N/A,08/21/2018,03:58pm

https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,N/A,CornDog,I see you are in Mansfield. I’m a tad south of Toledo. Been thinking about a Christmas ale for this year and I remembered I bookmarked this recipe. Need to scale back a bit as I feel comfortable with about 12 lbs of grain in my 7 gal Megapot with water (BIAB) for 5 gal batch. Different topic...just picked up this year’s Nosferatu GLB and is very good this year. One of my annual favorites.,N/A,10/15/2018,11:59pm

You gotta try the recipe and tell me how you like it.    Next pot you get, get a 15 gal for BIAB  It's perfect for 5 gallon batches.   That's cool you are in Ohio too.

Tonight I kegged 2.5 gal of an Autumn Hard Cider ... I racked cider 6.3% onto some berries I harvest from my Korean Dogwood tree (taste like pumpkin and mango) and the some whole berry cranberry sauce, fresh ginger and some cinnamon. Tastes real nice with spice and snap of ginger but still apple enough. Taking some to my neighbors 50th B-day on Friday. Proud to serve it😀!",N/A,10/17/2018,11:39pm

In the recipe it shows 5 Min.  Which is correct?   Have you tried the spices in the second stage - like dry hopping.    I have seen some recommending in outer recipes to soak the cinnamon in vodka for an hour then adding the vodka to the secondary.   Thanks for sharing you recipe.  I plan on doing this one for the holidays.,N/A,10/26/2018,08:31pm
https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/39433,Cameron,"Hi Chasjs - Sorry about that.  It is confusing that I would put the ginger chunks and cinnamon sticks in for the full boil in the video but that's not how the recipe reads.   I've done it both ways with success.  Your question got me thinking about what would be the best time for them to go in.  I did some quick research on how to make cinnamon or ginger tea, which is really what you are doing in the wort.  I can't really remember a difference when I've done it at  60 or 5 but when you read how to make cinnamon tea or ginger tea it sounds like  throwing it in at the 15 makes better sense and leaving them in for 15 minutes after flame out.  I am going to change the recipe to adding them at 15 minutes left in the boil.

https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/282437/great-lakes-christmas-ale-clone,https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/39433,Cameron,Hi MarkT.  I peel some ginger root and cut up into pieces.  I take the ginger root and cinnamon sticks and put them in a muslin bag and tie it up. Here's the muslin bags:  https://www.homebrewing.org/Large-Muslin-Bag-_p_1480.htmlI tie a piece of cloth rope on the muslin bag and put it in the boiling wort.  I used to put it in at 60 min but I tried something different this the last batch I did a week ago. I put it in with 15 min left and at flame out I just left them in for another 15 or so minutes before I started chilling the wort.   I came up with that routine because you are basically making a tea in the wort. I occasionally dunk it in and out of the wort like a tea bag.Here are two links about making cinnamon and ginger tea:https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Simple-Version-of-Cinnamon-Teahttps://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-ginger-tea-3377239What's funny is last week when I made it I was a little low with my OG and I see that I forgot to grind and add 1.24 lbs of Wheat.
