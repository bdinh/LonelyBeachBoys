Then baked for another 45 mins at 350. Let it cool to 154 and add to mash. For the vanilla bean vodka solution, two vanilla beans are cut in half.  The seeds and goodies are then scraped into 4oz of vodka. Let the vodka sit for two weeks.

Too much honey will make the beer too dry and more alcohol forward than it needs to be.   I looked up how to make cinnamon or ginger tea, which is what we are doing in the wort, and it seems that putting them in at 15 minutes left in the boil and leaving them in for 15 minutes after flame out makes the best sense.  The video I made on YouTube says 60 minutes but I've changed it since I made that video. Great Holiday beer. Cheers !

Vi anbefaler en mengde mellom 250 g (mildt) og 1 kg (veldig kraftig). 500 g kan være et greit utgangspunkt og gir et godt merkbart, men ikke totalt dominerende ingefær-preg. Mengden meske- og skyllevann du bør bruke kommer an på utstyret og metoden du brygger med. Som et anslag kan vi si at du kan bruke 20 l meskevann og 13 l skyllevann til dette ølet. Noen bryggemaskiner (f.eks. Speidel Braumeister) kan kreve større mengder meskevann. Sjekk alltid manualen på utstyret du bruker. Mesking på 66 grader i 60 min. Utmesk på 77 grader i 5 min hvis du har mulighet til å øke temperatur i mesken.  Kjøl ned til 17 grader før pitching av gjær. Gjæring på 18 grader til stormgjæring begynner å avta (typisk etter 3-5 dager). Øk deretter til 20 grader og hold resten av gjæringsperioden (totalt 14 dager). Tørrhumle etter 5 dager. Gjæralternativer: WLP001, WLP007, WLP028, WLP051, WLP090, Danstar Nottingham

I plan to test different ABVs by adjusting the malt weights, but keeping the general grist intact. Also this malt bill would be the base for many different hop combos. For yeast I'm using the Conan strain, but experimenting with different English strains is another possibility. WLP007 Dry English Ale yeast is speculated to be the true yeast used (BYO, 9/15 issue). Many thanks to Trillium for being so open regarding ingredients on their website and JC for offering tips in the Beer Advocate forum.

Dette vil høyne OG'en din med omtrent 9 poeng (ved bruk av malt vil det selvsagt komme an på utbyttet ditt). Dersom du ønsker en krydret øl, kan du eksperimentere med klassiske ""julekrydder"" som ingefær, kanel, appelsinskall, muskat, koriander, stjerneanis osv. Men vær forsiktig med krydrene, de kan fort ta over smaksbildet i ølen totalt! Et relativt forsiktig utgangspunkt til 20 liter kan være:  20 g tørket appelsinskall, 5 min kok5 g koriander, malt, 5 min kok5 g ingefær, malt, 5 min kok Kjøl ned vørter til 17 grader før pitching av gjær. Gjæring på 17-18 grader under stormgjæring, 20 grader f.o.m. stormgjæring avtar, i totalt ~14 dager.

Lager at 32 for 21 days.Took 3-4 weeks to fully carbonate at room temp.Edited recipe on 7/19/12 to go to .5 lb Vienna malt from 1.25 lb.9/11/2013: Last couple of batches came out very slightly high in OG (1.050-1.053). Changing recipe today to show expected efficiency of 80%, and lowered pils malt and wheat malt to 7.5lb and 0.75lb respectively.Also, consider using different hops - German noble hops as stated in BJCP 6C.4/30: Used 8# Pils, 1# Wheat Malt, .5# Vienna. Got 5.5g @ 1.052.7/16/2016: Got very high efficiency, so I scaled the hops up in recipe to get 6.25 gal to fermenter. Note that my earlier IBU target had been 26. This batch will be 29. After brewing, efficiency was not so high, but still 80%. IBU will be 32. Back off on hps next time.1/21/2017: Modified recipe to target 24.6 IBU.

Let this first dry hop addition sit for three days then; 2) Add the second dry hop addition to the primary fermenter for four days (so seven days exposure for the first round of dry hops). Bottle or package immediately on the seventh day. Try to minimize oxygen exposure for best aroma retention. For example, if kegging, purge the keg with CO2 before transferring the wort. Also, I used this forum from HomeBrewTalk.com on Heady Topper for some direction: http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=390082 Basically the malt profile is very similar to Heady only scaled down to 7% ABV. The hop profile used HopShot for the 60 minute edition and a Citra/Mosaic combo for all other editions. This is very different from Heady, but is pretty well known to be the hop combo in Focal Banger.

Also added 13 g of grapefruit zest from 6 large grapefruits. Little worried because they had some green areas (underripe??). I washed them before zesting, then put them in a fine mesh bag and soaked them in sanitizer for ~1 minute. Then into the fermenter! OG = ~1.055FG = 1.015 Second brew - 10-30-13Dry hopped after 9 days with 1 oz fresh cascade and 0.5 oz fresh Citra.  Added 43 g of grapefruit zest from 3 large yellow grapefruits.  These ones yielded way more zest than the last ones! I washed before zesting, then put in a fine mesh bag and dunked in sanitizer before putting into fermenter. Third brew - 2-15-14With our full boil setup, had to reduce the hops so it wouldn't be too bitter. Otherwise, kept it mostly the same. This round of Citra hops was super high alpha.  Mashed 7.1 pounds grain in 3 gallons of water at ~150-152 for an hour. Heated up to 170, removed grains. Sparged grains with 3 gallons of 170 degree water. Going for a starting boil volume of ~6 gallons, with about a gallon of boil off.  OG - <1.06.  Measured ~1.06 then added another quart of water, and the yeast starter. Final volume (before yeast starter) ~4.75. After yeast starter, 5.2 gal or so. Fourth brew: All grain batch. 9-20-14First all grain batch! We used a single infusion mash @ 154. It dropped down to maybe 152 by the end of the hour. We opened the cooler and stirred every 15 mins. We collected 6.5 gallons for the boil, it had a gravity of 1.06. I have no idea what that makes our efficiency. Our final boil volume was ~5 gallons, but lost a good amount to trub (lots of hops). Volume was 4.5 gals with an OG of 1.07+. Added 3/4 of a gallon H2O, got it to ~1.64. Pitched yeast starter. Had a kraussen the next day!9-30-14 Dry hopped with 35 g of grapefruit zest from 7 small (washed) grapefruits. Also 0.5 oz citra and 1 oz cascade. Sanitized hops bags but not hops. Sanitized bag for zest and dunked the zest in sanitizer. Brew on 3/14/15-changed hop profile to decrease IBUs slightly base on taste of last beer. -doing larger boil volume to get right amount for fermentation-mashing at 152.- OG was a little low (1.06?). Think our efficiency was more like 60%.Dry hopping on 3/22/15- 39 g of zest from 7 small grapefruits. Tried a new technique for sanitizing: Sanitized whole grapefruits (after washing), microplane, and a bowl. Zested the grapefruits right out of the sanitizer.Putting zest into sanitized hop bag then into carboy. Avoids putting all the fresh zest into starsan.Used 1 oz cascade, 1 oz citra (up from 0.5 oz in previous batches), both whole leaf. Brewing 11-7-15Increasing hops because we want to. Making Northern Brewer 1 oz (instead of 0.75) and adding another half ounce of Citra, don't know when yet... update later.

The 190212 °F (88100 °C) range will allow essential oils with higher flashpoints an easier time to solubulize into the wort and also will allow some alpha acid isomerization to occur with the best estimates of between 515% utilization. Some homebrewers will keep their kettle burner on low to keep the temperature of the wort elevated above 200 °F (93 °C) during their extended hop stands which would better emulate the conditions in commercial whirlpools. A hop stand in the 160170 °F (7177 °C) range will basically shut down the alpha acid isomerization reaction and the lower temperatures will reduce the vaporization of the essential oils. Homebrewers can use their wort chillers to bring the wort down to this range before adding the knockout hops or they can add a second dose of knockout hops. The 140150 °F (6066 °C) range will once again reduce vaporization of the low flashpoint oils, but may take longer to get the same amount of essential oils extracted.

If you can't find Thomas Fawcett Amber, look harder. This is the exact malt DFH uses, and it's a distinctive flavor. It's available at quite a few online retailers if your LHBS doesn't carry it.  **Hopping: Mix all 5oz of hops together, how often you add them is up to you. Some people add a couple pellets every minute, others fill up 30 dixie cups, and add one cup per 3 minutes. Personally I do 10 additions, 0.5oz every 10 minutes, and it turns out excellent.  That's about it, it's actually a fairly easy beer to brew other than the continuous hoping. If you can't find WLP007, use WYeast 1098 - Dry Whitbread, or Safale S04. Definitely use WLP007 if it's available, the yeast character is dead on.  I just had a slightly tweaked version take 1st place for IIPAs in a competition.

This one is a slightly hoppy German Hefeweizen, with a reduced boil of 4 gallons boiled down to 3,  then adding 2 gallons of fresh pressed cider at the end of the boil and bringing the temp back up to 180 to sterilize any strange bugs before chilling and pitching the yeast.    Brew Day Notes: I did a thin mash at 1.5 quarts per pound grain.  Got much better efficiency than typical, 76%,  I usually hover around 70% with 1.25 qts/lb mash.  2 small sparges still took me to nearly 5 gallons so I had to boil for 1:30 to get down to 3 gallons.  I added 2 gallons cider that I just pressed and took the temp to 180.  Then chilled and pitched the yeast.  Cider this year is very sweet  15.2 - 17 brix. smaller apples from the hot dry summer seem to have have condensed sugar and flavor. Keg day note:  Beer finished at 1.008! Incredible attenuation.  Tastes fantastic, hefe with a cider twang as you would expect.   Naming this beer 'Skull Splitter'  for 2 reasons.  Super high ABV and I fractured my skull on a fluke accident harvesting apples this year.

Selected specifically because of their aromatic qualities, these Pacific Northwest varieties contribute a pungent blend of grapefruit, stone fruit, and floral notes. A generous malt bill and a solid dollop of honey provide just enough body to keep the balance in check, resulting in a remarkably drinkable rendition of the Double India Pale Ale style. - Do iodine test pre-boil to ensure conversion was successful - Days 1-7 Primary- Days 8-14 Secondary - Days 15-21 add dry hops to secondary - Day 22 Add 1 TSP of plain gelatin to secondary and cold crash 48 hours- Day 24 Rack to bright keg or bottle

The decoction measurements below are ones I developed for an electric system and err on the side of caution, so they are the lower amounts needed to potentially reach the next temperature step and direct heat can be applied to compensate.* Perform a protein rest at 125F for 15min, then pull off slightly less than 1/3 (1.16gal/4.4L) of the thickest mash and place it in a separate pot. Bring the pot slowly up to 158F and hold for 15min, then slowly bring it up to a boil and proceed to boil for 10min. Stir often so the grains do not burn, but try to allow some 'browning' to help darken the colour and enhance the flavour/aroma profiles. Add the decoction back to the 125F mash, little by little, aiming for a beta rest temperature of 148F. Hold this temperature for 30min while adding back any leftover decoction (if any) as it cools. After this has finished, pull off roughly 1/6 (0.7gal/2.6L) of the thickest mash a second time and place it in the separate pot. Slowly bring the pot up to a boil and continue to boil for 10min. Add the second decoction back to the mash, little by little, aiming for an alpha rest temperature of 158F. Hold this temperature for 30min while adding back any leftover decoction (if any) as it cools. Once this rest has finished, raise the temperature up to a mash out rest of 167F and hold for 10min. After the decoctions and mash out are finished proceed to sparge/lauter as usual. No Decoction: Instead of the labour intensive double decoction mash schedule you could: - Substitute some of the pilsner malt for vienna and/or munich to add colour and depth.- Include some melanoidin malt for a slight decoction 'feel'.- Add some carapils malt (or your preferred alternative) for improved head retention.- After which, just carry out a temperature/infusion mash schedule based on your preferences. **This beer won a national silver medal at the Saskatoon Headhunters Competition (2017) and has consistently scored 40's at other national competitions. ***When Saaz AA is 3.5%, all additions are Saaz 1.5oz, 2oz, 1oz, and 1oz.

This avoids lowering the mash pH too far and reduces the chance of astringency which can occur from over-steeping highly roasted grains. Once the 90 minute mash is over, stop the mash pump, add the roasted barley, and give it a good stir to mix it into the existing grain bed. You need to stir well as otherwise the fine layer of powdery roasted barley on top may stop the flow. Start the mash pump again and continue with your mashout. The wort will be cloudy again but it will clear as the grain bed rises to mashout temperature over 20-30 minutes.   Try and use the recommended White Labs WLP-004 or Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale yeasts. While something like Fermentis Safale US-05 (American Ale / Chico) yeast can be substituted and works well, it's just not the same as it's a bit too clean fermenting and lacks some of the complexity.   Serve this beer with fairly low carbonation (the lower the better in my humble opinion, or even better, as a cask ale). If you have the means to serve it through a beer engine with no extra carbonation at all other than residuals left over from fermentation, do it! I think you'll really enjoy the difference. I serve mine on a stout faucet pushed by 30/70 C02/Nitrogen blend to get a nice creamy head and close to flat beer, exactly how Guinness is served on tap. One cheap and inexpensive way to (sort of) mimic this is to use a syringe. Pour the beer as you would normally and then suck up a syringe full and force it back into the beer, hard. Repeat 2-3 times and you'll knock most of the C02 out of solution leaving a nearly flat beer with a creamy head. Over carbonation destroys a lot of the subtleties of this beer. Don't over carbonate! add 88% lactic acid to the beer after fermentation is done, before kegging. This is said to be what Guinness does today because it's cheaper, easier, and more efficient than relying on bacteria. All is takes is around 3-4 ml per 5 gallon keg. Go sparingly adding 0.5 ml at a time until the taste is to your liking. You can also use this method to do a trial run to see if you like the results: Once the beer is kegged and on tap, add 1-2 drops with an eye dropper to a 16 oz glass of beer and see what you think. 1 drop per 16 oz is equivalent to 2 ml in 5 gallons. Careful not to overdo it!

Cubby Claus is my invention and he's Santa's buddy, a guy who travels to the homes of kids who are Cubs fans to deliver them presents.  Each night on Christmas Eve, the kids leave out milk and cookies for Santa and beer for CC.  So I thought he'd need a porter with some spice and body to get him through the night.  After beer is added to fermenter, prepare a mix of wood chips and bourbon; rinse lightly to remove any dust or loose debris before boiling to sanitize and also to create an oak tea; place in container and add bourbon (I plan to use Crown Maple), then seal.  When primary fermentation is complete, add the bourbon/oak tea and chips to the fermenter (or add to secondary and rack on top) and sample every 24 hours or so to judge the flavor.  Might also add the chips to the primary and then reserve the remaining bourbon and add that to the keg and rack on top.  And, in case you were wondering, the spices are all ""C"" words and the hops are ""W"" as an homage to the flag flown after the Cubs win. 3 packets Nottingham, 33g

Scrape out and reserve all the seeds and ""gunk"" in them.  Cut the pods into roughly 2-3"" pieces and add the pods, seeds and ""gunk"" to a secondary fermenter.  Leave them there until you get the amount of vanilla flavor you like.  I usually start tasting at about a week and a half, and may leave them in until 2 weeks.  You may want to let them go a bit more than you think is necessary since the vanilla flavor fades with time.  When the beer is done in secondary, rack to a keg or bottling bucket with about 375 ml. of bourbon.  I use Jim Beam Black.  You don't need to use an exceptionally good bourbon.  The bourbon flavor should integrate with the porter and vanilla flavors, not stand out and shout ""Bourbon!""  You can determine the amount of bourbon for your own tastes through the following method....pour 4 2 oz. samples of the beer that goes into the bottling bucket or keg.  Dose each with a measured amount of bourbon.  Taste them to decide which you like best, then scale that amount up to your batch size.  This beers does not need, nor benefit from, extensive aging.  Generally, I prefer it within a couple months of brewing.

Use lactic acid to lower the pH to 4.5 then pitch the lacto.General rule is 1ml will drop 20l by 0.01When pitching starter, do not add chalk from the starter!5. Hold for 48 hours or until the pH is at 3.4-3.6.6. Boil for 60min7. Drop temp to 20c and put it into the fermenter.8. Add the sacc yeast and let it ferment out.9. Rack onto raspberries and leave until they've turned white.10.

See link. Heat Strike Water: Heat at least 4 gallons of water to 160165º, depending on the temperature of your grain. Mash temperature should be 152º F. Mash in: Using a mash paddle, mix the crushed grain with the water. Make sure to mix it up well to avoid any dry pockets, or dough balls. Once the mash is well mixed and sitting at 152º F, cover and let it rest for 60 minutes. Sparge: While your mash is resting, heat 5 gallons of water to 168º F. Perform a batch sparge to collect 7 gallons of wort and bring to a boil. The Boil:As soon as you see a rolling boil, set your timer for 60 minutes and add 0.5 oz Centennial hops. Boil for 40 minutes then add 1 oz Cascade hops. Boil for 10 minutes then add 1 oz Cascade hops. Boil for 10 minutes then add 2 oz Citra hops and turn off heat. Allow to steep 10 minutes before chilling. Cool and Aerating the Wort: Cool the wort to below 80°F using an ice bath, adding ice made from boiled water to top off your full volume, or using a wort chiller (best method). Once your wort is below 80°F, transfer it into your primary fermentor, and take a hydrometer reading. See our FAQs for tips on taking a hydrometer reading. Use One of These Methods for Aeration: Pour the cool wort between two sanitized buckets several times. Mix and stir vigorously for several minutes with a sanitized spoon. Aerate with the Midwest Supplies Aeration system for up to 10 minutes (7862). Add pure oxygen for 2 minutes with the MidwestSupplies Oxygenation Kit 2.0 (40033). Fermentation: Pitch (add) your yeast and store your fermentor in a dark area witha stable temperature of 6572°F. Leave until primary fermentation is complete, usually between 714 days. If youre unsure, take a hydrometer reading. Optional, but highly recommended: Rack to a 5 gallon carboy for secondary fermentation and aging. Midwest recommends a 3 week secondary fermentation for this kit. Dry Hops: 5-10 days before packaging the beer add 1 oz Citra and 1 ozCascade to the fermenter.  Bottling: Remember to clean and sanitize all of your bottling gear. Mix primingsugar with 2 cups of water and boil for 5 minutes. Cool and add to your bottling bucket. Rack your beer on top of the priming solution, making sure it gets mixed in well. Bottle and cap. Once bottled, store in a dark place between 6572°F for 12 weeks to carbonate. Enjoy with friends and family!

Be sure to crush the oat malt well as it tends to crush differently than the barley.2. Add wheat flour to the mash.  If not doing BIAB add rice hulls. (Some say add the flour to the boil, but my experience is that it doesn't dissolve and just creates dough ball lumps.)3. Do a high temp mash.  You may need to mash for 90 minutes.4. Use around a 1:2 sulfate to chloride water profile.5. Add green apple puree with 20 minutes left in the boil.  This adds pectin to create haze and body.6. Add the lactose sugar with 10 minutes left in the boil.7. Add whirlpool hops slowly over a 45 minute period starting at flameout, keeping the whirlpool moving the whole time.8. Add half of dry hops in 2-3 days, when the krausen is still high.9. 4-6 days later, when fermentation is mostly done, rack into a secondary and add vanilla bean, mango pulp, and ground green cardamom.  (Can skip secondary and add it right to the primary if you have enough head room.)10. Allow to condition on the fruit alone for 4-6 days, then add the rest of the dry hops.11. Cold crash and package 4-8 days later. Target starting fermenter volume is 6+ gallons to end up with 5 gallons after all the loss to dry hopping and fruit.  Use at least a 6.5 gallon fermenter. Add a few drops of Fermcap-S to prevent blowoff.

May have a light buttery character (although this is not required). Hop aroma is low to none (usually not present). Quite clean. APPEARANCEAmber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a deep reddish hue). Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head. FLAVORModerate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with a buttered toast or toffee-like quality. Finishes with a light taste of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish. Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light English hop flavor. Medium-low hop bitterness, although light use of roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness to the medium range. Medium-dry to dry finish. Clean and smooth (lager versions can be very smooth). No esters. MOUTH FEELMedium-light to medium body, although examples containing low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Smooth. Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish ales). May have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions. IMPRESSIONAn easy-drinking pint. Malt-focused with an initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish. INGREDIENTSMay contain some adjuncts (corn, rice, or sugar), although excessive adjunct use will harm the character of the beer. Generally has a bit of roasted barley to provide reddish color and dry roasted finish. UK/Irish malts, hops, yeast. EXAMPLESThree Floyds Brian Boru Old Irish Ale, Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale (a bit strong at 6.5%), Kilkenny Irish Beer, O'Hara's Irish Red Ale, Smithwick's Irish Ale, Beamish Red Ale, Caffrey's Irish Ale, Goose Island Kilgubbin Red Ale, Murphy's Irish Red (lager), Boulevard Irish Ale, Harpoon Hibernian Ale VITALOG:1.044-1.060 FG:1.010-1.014 IBU:17-28 SRM:9.0-18.0 ABV:4.0-6.0%

Cascade is used as a finishing hop. Mash in at 67C. It will be difficult to reproduce this beer because we use a proprietary strain of yeast that is not available anywhere. Its parentage is California Ale yeast but it is very different at this point.

Stir grain bed really well to get an accurate temperature. -Let Mash rest for 75 Mash minutes, periodically checking the temperature and stirring the mash. -At 0 Mash minutes, begin sparging of wort.  Ensure wort is clear of grains before allowing wort to fill in boiling kettle.  Flow rate should be monitored.  Entire wort volume should take ~ 40 minutes before boiling kettle is filled. -keep mashtun from running dry as boiling kettle fills by adding the remaining 170*F water periodically. -Bring Wort to a rolling boil, Boil for 60 minutes. -Hops/additives additions:*0.5 oz Magnum hops for 60 minutes*1.0 oz Perle hops for 60 minutes*1 whirfloc tablet or Irish moss added at 15 minutes.*Wort chiller added at 15 minutes.*2.0 oz Cascade hops for 15 minutes*1.0 oz Cascade hops for 0 minutes -Bring wort to room temperature using immersion coil/ wort chiller. -transfer wort fermenters and aerate by vigorously mixing. -sprinkle Safale US-05 and mix.  Seal fermenters and set aside for 3-7 days or until airlock bubbles slow to 1-5 bubbles every 60 seconds.  -Move to secondary for 7 days.*3.0 oz Cascade hops dryhopped for 4-7 days in secondary. -Once the trub bed is settled and there is no airlock activity, the beer can be bottled or kegged. Bottling will require you to boil a mixture of maltodextrin and water.  Use priming calculator to determine amount of maltodextrin and water to boil. If you are kegging your beer like myself, shoot for a volume of CO_2 Level of 2.6.  Set regulator to 10.8-12 psi and kegerator temperature to 36-38*F.  That should do it.

The advice from my LHBS wasn't enough for a clear explaination until, the suggestion of Dave Lines' books published by AW.  With these (the big book of beer & brewing beers like those you buy) in hand the procedure became understandable and process replicable. This was a while ago in the mid-80's when home brewing information, ingredients, recipes, equipment, and knowledgble dialogue not as simple to find as it can be today.  My interest piqued I continued to seek information and put what I learned into practice learning to brew beer.  It was a lot of fun to make and enjoy a homebrewed beer.  It still is! Thanks for the help Dave.  This batch is for the memory of you and your efforts are remembered and appreciated.  Thanks for the learning experience.Cheers.

Clarity (whirlfloc + gel) really helped. Lacing and head are spot on. The bittering could come up a tick (from 60 to 70 perhaps.) Amarillo feels pretty orang'y and almost mellow! Maybe try the same recipe but swap some of the Amarillo for Cascade or event Centennial (more aggressively citrus'y.) I think using two ""aroma"" hops isn't enough. Something heavy hitting like Simcoe, Centennial, etc is needed for the heavy, hoppy backbone... Now to try Centennial instead of Citra and make the adjustments mentioned above: http://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/91377/hopstand-ipa-v4-centennial-amarillo

Let it cool and then add to the primary before closing and pitching.  Make sure to use a blow-off tube, as the fermentation can be extremely vigorous. For the secondary fermenter, add the other 1/2 of the blackberries directly when transferring. The final result is a very smooth, crisp, and light beer.  The blackberries provide a strong flavor as an aftertaste, but the beer isn't sweet.  It almost tastes like a cider.

So, actually it is a 50 minute boil, not a 45 minute boil. Other than that, it is a straight forward extract batch. To get it to qualify as an Amber Ale, had to set the IBU equation to Rager, and the SRM equation to Daniels. I'm open to suggestions on the style (haven't tasted it).

Nice! Needs a bit more fresh orange peel. Over all well balanced and very drinkable for an 8% brew.  New addition for 3/28/13 brew. Adding lime peel and using freshly zested clementine peel.  Add Orange Blossom honey at 10 minutes to flame out. Crush Coriander seed with a mortar and pestle and add to a herb ball for the 10 min. boil.  Brewed on 6/28/12. Kegged 2 weeks later. Carbed on 8/16/12. Great orange notes with a hint of the Coriander. The first attempt on this I boiled it for only 5 min. I have changed the recipe to 10 min. Overall a great refreshing beer! 8/30/12 The orange has mellowed and the Coriander has picked up some on flovor. I will still extend the boil to see how it effects the recipe.

I think the hop level is OK and while the predicted bitterness is a lot higher than the commercial 14 I am hoping half the hops in the boil will bring the flavours up. Also added a little crystal as it came out quite Pilsner like. Latest version I Upped to an ounce of each between boil and whirlpool, dropped the crystal back and due to having a few kids to deal with I mashed lower and ended up with a higher efficiency - looked and smelled great going into the fermenter, time will tell. Third attempt nailed the flavour, so I am dropping the grain bill back to match original and changing the times of boil addition - flavour extraction should still be good as they will be there throughout the whirlpool anyway. Aroma was already fantastic.

These two ingredients are added to the secondary fermentation along with the vanilla bean and cinnamon sticks. For the dried cherries, recipe states to soak the fruit in the first 2 quarts of wort runnings for 30 minutes. Strain out the cherries and add the solution to the end of the boil. In a previous batch, I had kept the cherries and added those into the primary fermenter. It didn't hurt and it sure seemed to help. And this works better than adding the dried fruit to the wort. Recipe states to mash at 152 degrees for 60 minutes. Mash out (sparge) at 168 degrees for 10 minutes. Don't forget to soak the cherries in mash runnings. Add DME and maple syrup when wort starts to boil. Obtain SG. Boil for 60 minutes. Add hops at beginning. Add strained cherry juice at end of boil. Obtain SG. Chill wort. No additional water should be necessary. Obtain SG. Pitch yeast. Add cherries. Seal and let ferment. At 10 days or so, transfer to secondary fermenter. Add vanilla, cinnamon sticks, tart cherry juice, orange peel. Let ferment at least two more weeks. Measure SG. If SG is at target, filter from carboy, mix with priming sugar, and bottle.

Higher levels give a less fermentable wort and a more full-bodied beer. Roast Cocoa nibs at 300 for 10-15 minutes. Add cocoa nibs, dark bakers chocolate and first addition of coffee at flameout. You can skip this coffee addition for a more balanced or less coffee flavored beer. Then maybe only do .5oz coarse ground coffee in secondary. Filter off hops, coffee, cocoa into fermenter.  After ferment rack onto coarse ground coffee for 7 days. Coffee can be soaked overnight in vodka. Coffee Must be coarse! I boil about 1/4 gallon every 15 mins in a 4 gallon (16 quart) kettle so it took me an hour to boil off 1 gallon. I adjusted recipe to start with 2 gallons. Head Retention: It's possible oils from the cocoa or coffee beans can reduce head retention. Choose dry beans. Or soaking them in vodka can help.

I bumped the base malt up to 9 lbs because I was not getting 78% eff on my mash and even his numbers for 78% didn't mesh with my brewing software.  Go with about 9 lbs pale malt to get you in the OG range of 1.056.  I fermented with White Labs 830 German Lager as Grady suggested at ale temps in the 68-72 dF range,  Final beer was meh, ok I guess compared to the actual 1554.....mine was far too fruity & diacetyl.  Notes that I took based on the finished beer kept the grain bill and hops the same, but changed the yeast to WLP029 German Ale/Kolsch with warm fermentation temp (68-74 dF).  I don't stock that yeast, but can order it on a Monday and have it in store by Friday.  You could probably have similar result with a dry yeast SD-23 if you can ferment it around 68-72 dF,  I completely agree with Grady on fermenting with a lager yeast at ale fermentation temps.  They produce a huge amount of diacetyl and off flavor by-products at those warm temps, but are masked/offset by the extreme peppery spice profile from the addition of Paradise Seeds.  After sampling my version of this beer with Mike Dixon (national bjcp judge), I'm convinced that it could be made with WYeast 3463 Belgian Forbidden Fruit strain and fermented in the 70ish dF range as well.   What I get from the brewery (Grady Hull, asst brwmstr):60% Pale malt, then carapils, munich, black and chocolate.Mash at around 154° for 45m.21 IBU's of Target for 35m, lager yeast fermented around 65ish.He also commented on my recipe assumptions, which gave a few more hints.I'm now thinking something like: 1555 Batch Size: 5.50 gal Boil Volume: 7.33 gal Boil Time: 75 min Brewhouse Efficiency: 78.00 %Actual Efficiency: 78.12 %  Ingredients Amount Item Type % or IBU 7 lbs Pale Malt (2 Row) US (2.0 SRM) Grain 60.22 % 1 lbs 14.0 oz Munich II (Weyermann) (8.5 SRM) Grain 16.13 % 1 lbs 8.0 oz Cara-Pils/Dextrine (2.0 SRM) Grain 12.90 % 12.0 oz Chocolate Malt (350.0 SRM) Grain 6.45 % 8.0 oz Black (Patent) Malt (500.0 SRM) Grain 4.30 % 0.75 oz Target [11.00 %] (35 min) Hops 21.9 IBU 2.0 oz Grains of Paradise 0 min1 Pkgs German Lager (White Labs #WLP830) Yeast-Lager  Beer Profile Estimated Original Gravity: 1.058 SG (1.050-1.075 SG)Estimated Final Gravity: 1.015 SG (1.010-1.022 SG)Estimated Color: 34.9 SRM (30.0-40.0 SRM)Bitterness: 21.9 IBU (35.0-75.0 IBU)Estimated Alcohol by Volume: 5.61 % (5.00-7.00 %)   Mash Grain Weight: 11.63 lb Mash PH: 5.4 PH Grain Temperature: 72.0 F Sparge Temperature: 168.0 F Sparge Water: 4.14 galName Description Step Temp Step Time Mash In Add 14.53 qt of water at 168.9 F 154.0 F 45 min Mash Out Add 5.81 qt of water at 209.8 F 168.0 F 10 min   Carbonation and Storage Carbonation Type: Kegged (Forced CO2) Carbonation Volumes: 2.6 (2.3-2.9 vols) Estimated Pressure: 14.4 PSI Kegging Temperature: 42.0 F Age for 2 weeks Storage Temperature: 42.0 F

I made no attempt to prevent the cloudiness of the beer, so it's cloudy, but that's what I like. I was inspired by Cigar City's Guayaberas to make an IPA that was not excessively bitter, but was very juicy and delicious, with large grapefruit notes.  Brewing notes:There are very little hops used in the boil. Only 1 oz at 60 mins. 2 ounces went into the kettle at a 180º whirlpool, which I stirred for 15 minutes. I used a large amount of hops, -5oz-, to dry hop, along with the zest of two grapefruits. The dry hop and zest were added in sanitized bags, with a sanitized spoon to make them sink. I used distilled water built up to the specifications listed in my water chemistry profileI'd even like to try the recipe again and adjust the hop schedule. I didn't think it was excessively bitter, but I'd like to try skipping the 60 minute boil and adding a 10 minute hop addition. I'll try it when I'm not as burned out on NE IPA's.

The NHC Final batch finished at 1.008 and was noticeably better with more ""pop"" than my 1st Round batch (FG 1.010).  A 60 minute+ rest at 146 or so is key, in my opinion. Hybrid of Coors Banquet & Budweiser.  Both beers use approx 70:30 barley:adjunct Coors: 70% 2-Row and 30% CornBud: 70% 6-Row and 30% Rice This beer uses approx 90:10 6-Row:Corn.  Decreasing the adjunct keeps the beer w/i style guidelines but it still actually tastes like beer.  Most of my macro-hating beer snob friends like this beer, FWIW. The batch brewed for NHC 1st Round in early Jan-17 was a 6 gallon batch and used WLP 840.  This batch split between WLP840 and WLP850.  Submitted bottles of WLP 840 to NHC Finals.  850 made a Heineken-like lager... a perfectly decent beer but the 840-half was more to-style.  WY2007 also works well for this beer, and WY2035 is great but only has seasonal availability.

Poured into a standard American pint glass, the beer is a golden straw color, with tight carbonation and a slightly off-white head that leaves a lovely lacing. The aroma is floral, fresh grass, pine needles, grapefruit, and some subtle notes of fresh bread.  Steeping grains:Steep grains at 66-70 for 45 mins. Not expecting much conversion... it's mainly for body, flavour, freshness, colour and head retention.

Be sure to crush the oat malt well as it tends to crush differently than the barley.2. Use around a 1:2 sulfate to chloride water profile.3. Add green apple puree towards the beginning of the boil.  This adds pectin to create haze and body.4.  Add flour with 20 minutes left in the boil.  See note below.5. Add the lactose sugar with 10 minutes left in the boil.6. Do not add fining.7. Add whirlpool hops slowly over a 45 minute period starting at flameout, keeping the whirlpool moving the whole time.8. Ferment in the warm range9. Add half of dry hops in 2-3 days, when the krausen is still high.10. 4-6 days later, when fermentation is mostly done, rack into a secondary on top of vanilla bean and fruit puree.11. Allow to condition on the fruit alone for 4-6 days, then add the rest of the dry hops.12. Cold crash and package 4-7 days later. Target fermeter volume is 6+ gallons to end up with 5 gallons after all the loss to dry hopping and fruit etc.  Use at least a 6.5 gallon fermenter. Add a few drops of Fermcap-S to prevent blowoff. Flour in the boil tends can make sticky dough balls.  Wondra Flour dissolves better than regular flour.  Use a sifter if you have one and add slowly. Tired Hands Milkshakes only use Citra and Mosaic hops.  Consider adding Simcoe for dankness. Consider substituting Galaxy or Azzaca for the Citra for a more mango candy sweet, less citrus hop profile.

We were shooting for roughly a 6-8% loss in water volume during the boil process. The cascade hops were added at the 55 minute mark or 5 min boil time instead of 10 min. We wanted to retain more of the hop essential oils and aromas in the wort. The beer had quite a bit of sediment/trub in the pot as we experienced a few clogged hoses and a clogged pickup tube during the racking process from the boil kettle to the fermenter. Most of the sludge was due to hop material that had absorbed liquid wort. Next time it would be worth the effort to contain the hops in a cheesecloth bag or some type of strainer vessel. 10 gal brew pot #1 had additional water added after the boil to bring up the volume to roughly 5 gal. Not sure why there was a significant difference between pot #1 and pot #2 with regard to water losses during the boil. Perhaps pot #1 had a more vigorous boil. Post-boil gravity was 1.075 in a 70 degree room. Racked beer to keg on 1-22-17. Initial tasting was excellent.

Tried multiple versions. Don't bother with a partial mash or extract. They discolor the beer and take away from the crispness of the all grain version. Brewed this 3 times now and pretty much always have it on draft. Everyone's favorite, every time. Belgian Candi sugar should be a late addition (15 min remaining) and OJ should added at flameout. Best to use fresh nutmeg and coriander if you can find them. I buy them whole and then crush them with a rolling pin just before adding to the boil. Ferment for 14 days at a constant 70 degrees if possible.Cold crash for 3 days then rack to keg, and force carb at 2.2 volumes If you want the traditional cloudiness of a wit to drop out, add gelatin before crashing.

Need about 30-100 billion cells.  0.5 liter 1.04 lacto starter 24 hours before keep at recommended temp and swirl but don't areate unless brevis.  Add 5g-10g chalk an ounce of pasteurized Apple juice and some  yeast nutrients if desired.  OR, make a 0.5 l starter with 2 tsp of non fat Greek plain yogurt and do it all at 110f...   - To sour 5 gallons of wort with yogurt, make a 1 liter batch of unhopped starter wort the day before brew day. Add 2-4 teaspoons of live yogurt to the starter wort. Maintain a 100-110°F (37.8-43.3°C) temperature for about 24 hours. On brew day, and after the 24 hour sour starter is finished, mash and sparge a low IBU wort as normal, boil for a few minutes, and then chill the wort down to 100-110°F (37.8-43.3°C). Pitch the yogurt starter into the wort, and hold the temperature as close to the 100-110°F (37.8-43.3°C) range as possible. Bubbling CO2 through the wort is advised if possible to prevent potential off flavors, but is not required. Within 24 hours, the wort should be down in the 3.x pH range. Boil the wort, adding any hops that the recipe calls for, yeast nutrient, etc., and then cool the wort down to Saccharomyces pitching temperatures. Bob's your uncle! [2] Refer to milk the funk wiki.

Transfer to secondary for dry hop for 4-7 days. Transfer to keg or bottling bucket for packaging. This extra step while not crucial likely helps reduce the bitterness and enhances the fruitiness of the citra hops.  This batch could also benefit from a few weeks of conditioning. Young heavily citra based beers have been reported to have off flavors. The flavor seems to greatly improve after 2-4 weeks of aging. Note: Lawson reportedly uses Gambrinus malt as the base for some of his beers. The pale malt wasn't available so I substituted with their ESB malt. This will add slightly more color and malt flavor than the pale malt.

Then add #2.25 for 4 days before racking to secondary. Also added 1# rolled oats to mash to try and add body. Don't want to add dextrin. Pretty sure Rubeaus uses dextrin malt, but it gives me gas. For version #1 I added 12oz each of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries at the end of primary, then added 2.25# of raspberries after primary for 3 days.

The original recipe is here: http://www.thebrewingnetwork.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=15591.  The judges determined that the recipe was very close, but not identical.  I am following their suggestions to scale back the IBU's and use a big pitch of yeast.  The original recipe calls for Carastan, which my LBS does not carry, so I am substituting Crystal 40L (the additional color is offset by the fact that the recipe actually calls for Crystal 45L).  The recipe also calls for Northern Brewer as bittering hop, but I am substituting Chinook since I have a lot of it.  I also refactored for my usual 70% efficiency and smaller batch size, and to achieve target numbers using slightly different ingredients.  The brewer suggests a mash temp of 152, but I will shoot for 148-150 to try to hit the stated target final gravity of 1.014.  After my first attempt, I found the malt profile to be spot-on, but a little lacking in hop aroma and flavor, so I am doubling the dry-hops to 3oz for my next attempt.

Try different yeasts and see what you like, if you want to.   Indian Summer Apple Cider contains Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a preservative, so it has no affect on yeast fermenting.  Any other cider using ascorbic acid would have similar results.  Don't use a cider with potassium sorbate, it will kill your yeast. DIRECTIONS:Pour the cider into your sanitized primary fermenter.  I used 1 gallon glass jugs and did 2 gallons at the same time.  Use a sanitized funnel if you're afraid of spilling. Leave some room at the top of the jug, but you don't need to leave a lot of room, as there won't be a tremendous krausen like with beer. Drop the raisins in, anywhere from 15-25 is fine. Add 1/2 packet of Lalvin 71b-1122 yeast per gallon.   Seal with a sanitized airlock and wait for 2-3 weeks, or up to 6 weeks.  When you get beyond 8 weeks, you might have more yeast characteristic come out in the cider. As fermentation occurs, the airlock will bubble and the cider will be cloudy. The hard cider is ready when the cider is nice and clear golden color, and the yeast has settled on the bottom of the fermenter. Bottle like beer, with your preferred level of carbonation.  I typically use 0.8oz per gallon of dextrose, or 1 carbonation tab per bottle if I'm feeling lazy. This cider purposely has a low alcohol content.  I find it quite drinkable and smooth, a bit tart like a granny smith apple.  You can ratchet up the alcohol by adding brown sugar or more sugar if you like, but I prefer my cider to have a lower ABV.  Removing the 3oz of cane sugar (table sugar) would reduce this to about 4% abv and also makes a very tasty and easy drinking hard cider.

Pitched 3 vials of the White Labs 004 Irish Ale, didn't have time for a starter. Aside from being about half a percent less in alcohol than that actual Jeremiah, it should be a pretty well balanced Irish Ale (Irish Strong Ale, as BJ's is classifying it). The WLP004 if suppose to attentuate pretty well so I may end up with a drier finish, similar to an Irish stout, or it may just slow early and produce a maltier flavor (which is more like the original). Cheers!

We can go with 1 or many varieties depending on what's available. The bittering hop just needs to hit around 20IBUs. Hop oil could be used for the bittering. Batch 1 Description - This beer is based upon a New England Style DIPA with a twist of fruit, lactose, and vanilla in order to add the perception of a fruited milkshake. The hops and fruit should compliment one another and create complex synergistic flavors. The fruit will be added after primary fermentation starts. Roughly 3-5 days in to fermentation while the yeast is still active but settling down. Once the fruit begins actively fermenting we will add first round of dry hops. Second round will be added when at or near final gravity. Roughly 4-5 days for each round of dry hopping. The vanilla beans are split and scraped and soaked in vodka then added during dry hop 2 or with the fruit. *optional The green apples are added near the end of boil and introduce pectins for a perma-pectin haze ;) (about 1 green apple per gallon). 		  2nd Batch Description - This New England Style DIPA will use the same grain bill and hopping additions as the milkshake style DIPA but without the extra ingredients of fruit, lactose, and vanilla in order to create a comparison study between the two styles. DH1 will be added after primary fermentation peaks about 3 days in. DH2 will be added when at or near final gravity. Roughly 4-5 days for each round of dry hopping.

VERY late addition hops. Ease off on the Amarillo tiger. I want to make a super clear but pungent IPA of the style we enjoy in San Diego. Simple malt bill, clean bittering, and all late addition hops of Centennial for flavor, and Amarillo for the nose.  Steps: - Brew beer & ferment.- Wait 2 more weeks- Transfer to secondary & dry hop.- Wait 3 days- Dry hop again- Wait 3 days- Keg & add gelatin.- Carb up the keg ==== 2/8/14 ====- Well, here goes again. This time I did 13lb 2-row, 1lb Carapils, 1lb C10.- Got some belgian 550 to mix it up and do a belgian ipa.- Going to ferment at 66º then raise it to 68º after the first couple weeks.- Going to wait 3 full weeks before transfering to secondary and dry hopping.- Using all fresh hops from the store (not from my freezer) and not going to freeze them. Just putting them in the fridge.- Also trying first wart hopping.- Also bumped the boil from 60 to 90.- OG: 1.065 (hydro reading. Dead on)- Blunder: I did mix up my final hops. So I added 1oz Cent and 1oz Amarillo at the 5min mark, then 1 oz Amarillo at the 0 min mark.

Una volta pronto: messo in frigo per qualche giorno per sedimentare almeno un po' il lievito. Appena fuori dal frigo ne elimino un po' nel lavello, facendo tornare il volume a 1,2 litri. Il luppolo usato era del raccolto 2012 (vecchio 1 anno e mezzo!) quindi ho ridotto gli AA stimati. Cotta: 30/03/2014 Togliere dal frigo lo starter del lievito e decantare con delicatezza un po' di liquido, eliminandolo nel lavello. Mettere in frigo (e poi nel freezer, stando attento che non ghiaccino) le 4 bottiglie d'acqua. Infusione grani (120g CaraPils + 120g CaraMunich II) in poco meno di 1 litro d'acqua, circa 68°C x 30 minuti. -In parallelo cominciare a portare a bollore il pentolone con circa 9 litri d'acqua, aggiungendo mezzo cucchiaino di Gypsum. -Con un cucchiaione raccogliere un po' di trebbie in un grosso colino/colapasta, a formare un letto di trebbie.-Scaldare un po' d'acqua in un pentolino.-Pseudo-sparge sulle trebbie, filtrando attraverso il colino, versando nel pentolone l'acqua appena scaldata del pentolino. -Rabbocco pentolone fino a 11,5-12 litri-Porto a bollore-In parallelo scaldo una latta di LME per ammorbidire l'estratto. -Aggiungo latta di LME + il sacchetto con 350g di DME. Bollire per 45 minuti:12g Perle + 12g Saphir -Scaldare intanto l'altra latta di LME per ammorbidire l'estratto, e aggiungerla a 10 minuti dalla fine. -Inserire la serpentina di rame appena prima di spegnere il fuoco. -Spegnere il fuoco -Aggiungere 8g Citra, 7g Perle, 6g Saphir e lascare in infusione. -Raggiunti gli 85°C aggiungere 10g Citra, 8g Perle, 6g Saphir. -Sotto i 75°C avviare la serpentina per raffreddare il mosto. -Sanificare: fermentatore, imbuto, rubinetto, gorgogliatore. -Aggiungo l'acqua delle bottiglie refrigerate, cercando di non ossigenare il mosto. -A 20°C travaso nel fermentatore filtrando e lasciando una/due dita di melma nel pentolone. -Controllare OG e incoculare il lievito. NOTA: le infusioni di luppolo a fuoco spento sono ben poco utili se durano pochissimo tempo. Calcolare una pausa un po' più lunga (mettere luppolo solo nel breve passaggio tra gli 85°C e i 75°C è inutile!) Dry Hopping con aggiunte multiple, (semplicemente perché speravo di ricevere in tempo luppolo più fresco): 06/04/201420g Citra (2012)10g Chinook (2012)7g Perle (2012)7g Willamette (2012) 10/04/201420g Citra (2012)10g Chinook (2012)7g Perle (2012)7g Willamette (2012) 11/04/201410g Citra (2012) 13/04/2014Travaso nel secondo fermentatoreFG: 1.012 14/04/2014Imbottigliamento Priming: zucchero bianco, 9 g/litro (147g x 16,3 litri). Stimo 3.0-3.2 volumi di CO2 Note: rotto 3 bottiglie da 50cl. Travasato il possibile in 4 bottiglie da 33cl. Alcune bottiglie non si sono tappate bene, non usare più Schwerter Brau e Peroni da 66! Primo assaggio a 2 settimane dall'imbottigliamento. Molto deludente. Due problemi evidenti: lievito troppo insistente e luppolo vecchio.  NOTA:Per la prossima volta: prima del dry hopping lasciar maturare la birra nel fermentatore almeno altre due settimane, e utilizzare luppolo non vecchio un anno e mezzo! Immagino che un paio di settimane in più nel fermentatore diano al lievito un po' di tempo per diventare meno invadente. Intuisco che le bottiglie avrebbero bisogno almeno di un altro mese di maturazione (in realtà sarebbero già pronte se fossi stato in grado di far flocculare di più il lievito, o di filtrare in qualche altro modo, ma i miei mezzi non lo permettono).Per riassumere: prendere in considerazione che questa birra porta in sé una contraddizione. Andrebbe bevuta più presto possibile per mantenere fresco l'aroma di luppolo, ma avrebbe bisogno di più maturazione per far perdere un po' di forza al lievito. Curioso di sapere come evolverà, anche se il luppolo, già messo male, temo che non potrà che peggiorare.Non l'avessi luppolata così tanto sarebbe una weizen decente, con il giusto corpo, la giusta dolcezza, la giusta acidità, la giusta carbonazione e persistenza di schiuma.Ora però al naso sento soprattutto lievito e luppolo vecchio. Non sento esteri (banana) o fenoli (chiodi di garofano, spezie), ma solo un generico e forte aroma di lievito weizen. Quindi sento il lievito, ma non quello che avrebbe dovuto produrre in fermentazione. Il luppolo vecchio rovina tutto, togliendole freschezza e ""beverinità"" (?). Citra e Chinook sono diventati generici luppoli, con sentori stantii/erbacei... Aggiornamento:ad un mese dall'imbottigliamento il lievito è meno insistente, ma solo facendo attenzione a tenere le bottiglie in verticale, e versando lentamente nel bicchiere, lasciando 1 o 2 dita di birra nella bottiglia. La carbonazione è eccessiva. 1) Fa sembrare la birra ""acquosa"". Il corpo non è assolutamente quello di una weizen.2) La schiuma è vulcanica. Carbonazione elevata, frumento e grandi quantità di luppolo la rendono esplosiva, densa e davvero troppo persistente, tanto da rovinare ulteriormente la bevuta. Il luppolo rimane un macello. Al naso sembra un'accozzaglia confusa, genericamente ""verde"" ed è seguita da uno spiacevole retrogusto. Anche il luppolo sembra mancare di ""corpo"". 26/11/2014Ultima bottiglia rimasta, ha sopportato l'estate a 30° nel terrazzo. La birra dopo 7 mesi in bottiglia si è chiarificata e sembra filtrata, color ambrato carico. Nessunissimo odore da weizen. Tutto arancia, agrumi, un po' di luppolo ""catty"", vaniglia e caramello. In bocca si è spostata tutta sul malto. Servirebbe più secchezza per ripulire la bocca. E' diventata molto meno sgraziata. Il lievito non dà più nessun fastidio, sembra un barley wine un po' troppo acquoso, o una IPA troppo dolce e troppo poco secca. E' senz'altro migliorata. Se avesse più luppolo ancora e un po' di corpo in più sarebbe similissima a tante double IPA provate con qualche mese sulle spalle! Ora mi verrebbe addirittura voglia di rifarne una uguale, ma con più luppolo, più secca e più amara. Forse basterebbe più amara, avrebbe bisogno di un amaro più tagliente. Il lievito dà zero problemi, e le note ""vegetali"" del luppolo vecchio in partenza sono scomparse. Ora sembra semplicemente una bottiglia vecchia, che ha passato l'apice. Cosa che non è (all'inizio era pessima).

One month or more before brew day prepare in a 1 pint mason jar makers mark Bourbon or whatever you like and 4 oz. of oak cubes. I also put in 3 Benilla vanilla beans cut up. Soak with oak one month or until they sink.  II. Four days before brew day make a huge starter using Wyeast1728. Use stirplate for best results. Follow favorite software recco.  III. There will be two mashes for this 6.25 gallon batch. The first mash is for kettle carmelaztion only/boil down. As opposed to taking just the first runnings this recipe is using a small separate mash/wort for boildown. Lot of work but delightful. End result will be one quart of caramelized wort. Recipe:I do this mash the day before main brew day. Set aside in the refrig.A. Mash: ph5.45 lbs.,simpsons golden promise 2-Row1/2 oz UK choc 250L1/2 oz Roasted Barley1/2 oz east kent goldings1.50 gal/H2O at 156-58 for one hour.Sparge for 20 minutes to get 6 qts and reserve balance for main boil. I mashed in a 5 gallon cooler in a bag.  Note: The gravity will be way higher than above recipe, due to the first mash with  unfermentable dextrins and long chain sugars. Looking for sweetness/flavors. Hence, the final gravity will also be higher. Check gravity 2-3 times towards the end of primary.   IV. Main mash see receipe above. Mash 1.35 gal/lb at 152F., for two hrs. Add water to maintain heat or recirculate-HERMS/RIMS, Stirring occassionaly, then, Sparge.  V. Combine 1st/2nd mash in boil pot. VI. Boil for 2 hours further caramelization.I continue adding reserved wort to the boil over the 2 hours. Sitting in the chair sipping with my hand on the propane valve. VII. Cool wort to 50F and transfer to fermenter. Put fermenter in an environment of 40-53F ambient. I use a 18 cubic foot chest freezer and a digital controller. Ferment cool/long.  VIII. Take gravity reading IX. Blast with pure O2 for 1 minute. X. Add Yeast Wyeast 1728 starter and shake. XI. 4 hours blast with O2 for one minute XII 8 hours blast with O2 for one minute XIII. 12 hours blast with O2 for 30 sec. Yes I actually, get up for this. VX. Primary fermentation for 3-4 weeks, your call.  XV.Day 7: Take gravity readingCarefully stir or walk the yeast. Poly stir paddle small end. Be gentle as not to induce oxygen or splash. Get those yeast back to work.  Day 14:Take gravity reading before stirring.Repeat procedure-walk yeastSanitation: Let you stir paddle live in a bucket of star-san next to the fermenter.Let it now settle for one more week. Day 21 take gravity reading.Total of 21 days in fermenter XVI.Day 21 transfere to secondary. Add oak cubes/two fresh vanilla beans only (not the oaked bourbon).(Save oaked bourbon for secondary if you want to add to it.)  Taste after one week and continue to until desired flavor is achieved, then remove oak/beans. Leave in secondary for 3 weeks or desired length at 50-55F. Update: I dropped the temp the last week to 45 ambient: fermenter prob around 49-50.  XVII.Day 42 Bottling bucket. Taste for Bourbon/vanilla. This is for the few who like bourbon/vanilla. I add 12oz. of makers mark and 1/4 cup of (Pure Macormick vanilla 40% ABV) to bottling bucket. If you like more oak/bourbon add some of the bourbon that the oak soaked in. This brew is not for the weak of heart and impatient. Allow to bottle condition for quite some time. This is one hell of a delicious bourbon/vanilla scotch ale for a sipper, cooled to 50F, and drunk in what my wife calls my diva glass. Cheers Good brewing! Update: Just tasted the first bottle 11/3/14. Still needs to go longer for best flavor. But, no kidding imo it is better than backwoods bastard. I just bought a case for $84 and compared the two. Mine is better hands down. I tweaked the recipe for what I think will be even better next spring when I make it again. (CHANGES)1.I will leave the oak cubes longer;2. Add 1 tbs more vanilla to secondary,and eliminate beans. 3. Increase hop rate-too sweet. 4. Added hops to kettle prep/caramelization batch. 5. Eliminated choc malt 450L and replaced with choc 250L.5. Increased roasted malt.6. Now cooling wort to 48-50F prior to racking to fermenter. Four wks secondary at 45 ambient. Also this ale needs 6 mos plus to age. Worth the wait! UDATE 2:Making this recipe this weekend. Adding 1/2 oz of magnum hops at 60 minutes. Beer was not quite bitter enough to match backwoods bastard. Also adding 1/2 cp more of makers mark bourbon.

Using the 2-chocolate approach used in Black Butte. First time using MOtter. Supposed to be more malt-forward. Lots of oats for head ret and velvet'y'ness. Victory for pie crust aroma.- Might need adjusting: Roasted Barley might need to come up from .4lb. Or maybe even sub it for Carafa2 or Carafa3 which is a very dark chocolate grain but less bitter than RB. If it's not sweet enough, maybe add more C80 or even lactose. Lactose might be better because it lacks the raisen'y of C80.- Aim for 30 ibu's. Use whatever, just make sure they're neutral.- Peanut Butter: People said 2 jars of PB2 in secondary wasn't enough. I'll go with all 4. In 32oz jar, add 1 jar of PB3 and 6oz nibs. Cover in vodka and let sit for a week or so. Boil other 3 jars of PB2 in a little water first (someone said they had an infection) and add it all to secondary. Also ordered some actual reeses cups in case that doesn't do it. If it still sucks, I ordered PB flavoring (which would suck.)- Someone said using a belgian ale yeast next time for some banana esters. Sounds fun but also a little busy.===2-23-14===- OG: 1.074 (Refracto). So I was a little high for some reason.

Put in a steeping bag and add it to the boil @40min left. ==All Spices:==After primary fermentation and a few days before bottling or kegging, make a small tea with the spices and dump them in. ==8/30/2013==- Subs: WLP005 British Ale. 1 vial, no starter.- BHE: 72%- OG: 1.072 (hydro).- I put the pumpkin in right at 60min. Also drizzled some maple syrup on top of the pumpkin b4 baking.- 9/15/2013 (16 days) - FG: 1.027. Going to remove from 68º and let it sit at 70-72º to let the yeast clean & finish. Hydro tasting was good, but maybe a little too much hop bitterness? I also feel like it's a little esthery and I get some yeast fruitiness. Not bad, but noticeable. If it doesn't get to 1.024 I guess I learned my lesson about skipping starters. VERY excellent color and clarity! Next time I might dial back the C40 by 1/2 a lb (from 1.5lbs). Tossing extracted vanilla bean in.- Result: Very very solid. Adjusting the mash temp from 158º to 154º to try and bring the sweetness down a tad and dry it out a bit. Also brought 1.5lbs of C40 down to 1.2lbs. If it's still too sweet next time, consider removing the vanilla bean. ===10/27/2013=== - OG: 1.070 (refracto) hmm. Brewhouse Efficiency calc said like 65% but this recipe at 71% says 1.07 OG which is what I got soooo wtf.- First time doing batch sparging. - Used a massive fine mesh bag for both the pumpkin and the hops. Not sure how this will effect the finished product. It was nice to not have to worry about all that pumpkin though!- FG: 1.2- Tasting notes: Batch #1 was WAY better than this batch. Notes for next time: WLP005 is the better yeast. Way less estery. As for the spices, 2 tsp is perfect. Just dump that tea straight in there (don't try to filter it.) For the pumpkin, muslin bags WIN. Don't try to do more complex filtering (nylon bag.)---===11/2/2014===- My efficiency has been sucking, so I bumped up the two row 1lb (to 12lbs).- Put the pumpkin in 2 mouslin bags. Great way to work with it. It decreases in size by about half towards end of the boil.- Baked the pumpkin as usual and drizzled some maple syrup on the top.- Pre-ferm yield:  5.5gal OG: 1.076 (hydro)- Pitched 1 vial of 005 with no starter. :-(- Tasting notes: ended up pretty thick, sweet, and a muddy orange color. Lowering the specialty grains to from 1.2lb C40, 1.5 Victory, 1.5 Wheat to 1lb each. Lowering the 60oz pumpkin to 30oz.

Amarillo, 3 Oz. Warrior, 3 Oz. Simcoe and blended together. Made 40 Dixie cups with 6.3 grams in each cup. Added 1 cup every 3 minutes for all of 120 minute boil.  Divided Dextrose into 28 individual 12 oz ziplock bags. After transfer to conical, started adding the second day, twice daily (12 oz in the morning and 12 oz in late afternoon) for 14 days. Towards the end, would see how fermentation was doing before adding. If fermentation slowed, re-think before you add more sugar as once added the final beer may be sweet.  1/2 gallon of wort was added to the high gravity yeast to make a starter. Second yeast was added on day 5 of fermentation.  Oxygen was added once daily for 4 days. 30 seconds @ 1200 psi with 0.2 micron SS Stone. Dry hopping: Added 2 oz. Amarillo, 2 oz. Warrior and 2 oz. Simcoe to a bowl and blend. 28 ziplock backs were filled with 6 grams of hops each. 1 bag was added with each evening addition of dextrose and continued for a total of 28 additions or 4 weeks. Fermentation was on the cold side, roughly 66-70 degrees. Lots of heat from the yeast. OF ended at 1.050. Let sit for a few days on yeast to help finish fermentation. Stopped adding sugar on day 13. Total dextrose added as 21.5 pounds. Re-calculated OG was 1.200. Bottled in 6 oz champagne splits, no addional yeast or sugar added. No carbonation. Final % with high gravity hydrometer was 20.7% abv. Beer has aged nicely and a wonderful treat for on a cold night or for a beer tasting event.

Transfer to another large fermentor on top of the raspberries (also the orange peel, lemon and lime).  You will need head space because the sugars from the fruit will restart the fermentation. You can put the fruit into a muslin bag to help separate the beer later on. After about two weeks on the fruit transfer to another fermentor.  This fermentor should be smaller since there will not be another fermentation. If there isn't enough lemon/lime taste add more before transferring to the final fermentor or bottling/kegging.
